MagicDbModelBuilder is a set of wrapper classes that enable the creation/configuration of models at runtime
through reflection. A feature that Entity Framework does not support, for now.

What you could do:

var builder = new DbModelBuilder();
builder.Entity<Post>()
  .HasKey(p => p.Id);


What you couldn't do:

var builder = new DbModelBuilder();
var wrapper = new DbModelBuilderWrapper(builder);
wrapper.Entity(typeof(Post))
  .HasKey(typeof(Guid), "Id");

Support for more methods to come...
